# ![NCC](assets/icon/ncc@32px.png "NCC")   NCC

Nosial Code Compiler is a program written in PHP designed to be a multi-purpose compiler, package manager and toolkit.
This program is a complete re-write of the now defunct [PHP Package Manager (PPM)](https://git.n64.cc/intellivoid/ppm)
toolkit offering more features, security and proper code licensing and copyrighting for the components used for the project.

## Alpha Stage

NCC is currently in alpha stage, meaning that it's not fully functional and may not work on your system. If you find any bugs

At the moment NCC is currently being used while developing other software, this serves as a test run to
improve on changes for the next version.
