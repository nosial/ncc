# ![NCC](assets/icon/ncc_32px.png "NCC")   NCC

Nosial Code Compiler is a program written in PHP designed to be a multi-purpose compiler, package manager and toolkit.
This program is a complete re-write of the now defunct [PHP Package Manager (PPM)](https://git.n64.cc/intellivoid/ppm)
toolkit offering more features, security and proper code licensing and copyrighting for the components used for the project.

## Alpha Stage

NCC is currently in alpha stage, meaning that it's not fully functional and may not work on your system. If you find any bugs
or issues please report them to the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://git.n64.cc/intellivoid/ncc/issues).

At the moment NCC is currently being used while developing other software, this serves as a test run to
improve on changes for the next version.

## Changelog

The changelog for NCC can be found in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Repository Mirrors

The official repository for NCC is hosted on [GitLab](https://git.n64.cc/intellivoid/ncc), however, you can also find
mirrors of the repository mirrored on different platforms, including 
community powered mirrors. (more to come)
