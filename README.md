ncc (Nosial Code Compiler) php package compiler written in PHP, it's designed to replace composer as a dependency manager
and package manager for PHP projects, with a focus on simplicity and the ability to create standalone packages while
trying to ensure (somewhat) compatibility with existing composer packages.

Version 3.+ is a complete rewrite of ncc, with a new architecture and design aiming to have better code maintainability
with a less-chaotic/hacky approach, allowing you to compiler your php projects into a ncc, phar or a single php file.
