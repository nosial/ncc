# v1.0.0 Alpha

First release of NCC (Nosial Code Compiler) in alpha stage.

## Alpha Stage

NCC is in its alpha stage, meaning that it's not fully 
functional and may not work on your system. If you find
any bugs or issues please report them to the 
[Issue Tracker](https://git.n64.cc/intellivoid/ncc/issues).

At the moment NCC is currently being used while developing
other software, this serves as a test run to improve on
changes for the next version.
